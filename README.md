## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS

For this project the goal was to make it look just like the images shown above. I used Flexbox to position my elements. I enjoyed the challenge presented in this project by having an image layered behind text. I had never done this before but then I learned that the background CSS property could do a lot more than just change the color of a background, but could also use images. So what I did was give the element an h3 in the HTML and set the background image in the CSS to the corresponding picture. This allowed me to get the layering effect.


## Lessons Learned:

While working on this project and others I was simultaneously learning Flexbox. This helped me to not only write better code but also learn how to ex. position elements more efficiently. Flexbox is such a powerful tool and really optimizes the visual experience has when using the site but also makes coding better for us as engineers because we can spend more time focusing on the functionality of the site and less time doing things like trying to center a section.
